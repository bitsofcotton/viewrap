microservice viewer wrapper on wasm (planned stub.)

# Context
There's some groups insists microservice and client side renderer is the best way to contribute containts.
So we need and we search some of the services on the cloud they provides some search engines'.
We need: wrapper to some of the containts/searcher for wrapper to microservice outputs GraphSQL, then, we want the view for their integrated containts as the wasm binary. So only the delegate to the service is the scripts, another settings/wasm itself can be static.
In the addition to them, they seems to plan to implement CDN static search engine (for not the freshest informations) / containts provider (archive) / user settings (as a file). So there seems to such CMS nor something on OSS, we need to search them first.
